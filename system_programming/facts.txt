* asterisk with executable file 
The asterisk is not actually part of the filename. You are seeing it because the file is executable and your alias for ll includes the -F flag:
	-F 
		Display a slash ('/') immediately after each pathname that is a directory, an asterisk ('*') after each that is executable, an at sign ('@') after each symbolic link, an equals sign (`=') after each socket, a percent sign ('%') after each whiteout, and a vertical bar ('|') after each that is a FIFO.
