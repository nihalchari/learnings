4.4.0-97-generic
This means that you are running Linux kernel 4.4.0-97 or in more generic terms, you are running Linux kernel version 4.4.
But what do other digits mean here? Let me explain it to you:
	• 4 – Kernel version
	• 4 – Major revision
	• 0 – Minor revision
	• 97 – Bug fix
	• generic – distribution specific string. For Ubuntu, it means I am using the desktop version. For Ubuntu server edition, it should be server.

Linux itsfoss 4.4.0-97-generic #120-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 19 17:28:18 UTC 2017 x86_64 x86_64 x86_64 GNU/Linux
Let me explain the output and give it a meaning:
	• Linux – Kernel name. If you run the same command on BSD or macOS, the result will be different.
	• itsfoss – hostname
	• 4.4.0-97-generic – Kernel release (we just saw that)
	• #120-Ubuntu SMP Tue Sep 19 17:28:18 UTC 2017 – This means that Ubuntu compiled 4.4.0-97-generic 120 time. Last compilation timestamp is also there.
	• x86_64 – Machine architecture
	• x86_64 – Processor architecture
	• x86_64 – Operating system architecture (You can run a 32 bit OS on a 64-bit processor)
	• GNU/Linux – Operating system (and no it won’t show the distribution name)
