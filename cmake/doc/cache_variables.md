two types of variables

    persistent cache variable
    Environment variables

All the variables written inside CMakeCache file are cache variables
some of this variables are automatically set by cmake tools
some are set when we execute command inside CMakeLists file
manually set Chace variable using set command, to do so mention CACHE keyword in set command
