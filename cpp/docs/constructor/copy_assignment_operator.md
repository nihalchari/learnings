A copy assignment operator of class T is a non-template non-static member function with the name operator= that takes exactly one parameter of type T, T&, const T&, volatile T&, or const volatile T&. For a type to be CopyAssignable, it must have a public copy assignment operator. 



Syntax
class_name & class_name :: operator= ( class_name )		
class_name & class_name :: operator= ( const class_name & ) 	 	
		
Forcing a copy assignment operator to be generated by the compiler. 		
class_name & class_name :: operator= ( const class_name & ) = default; 	 	(since C++11) 
		
		
Avoiding implicit copy assignment. 		
class_name & class_name :: operator= ( const class_name & ) = delete; 		(since C++11)


They take a single argument of type class-name& unless the assignment operators in all base and member classes take arguments of type const class-name&. In this case, the class's generated assignment operator takes a const argument.

When the argument type is not const, assignment from a const object generates an error. The reverse is not true: If a const value is assigned to a value that is not const, the assignment succeeds.
