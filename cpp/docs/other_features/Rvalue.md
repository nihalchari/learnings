Technically, an rvalue is an unnamed value that exists only during the evaluation of an expression. For example, the following expression produces an rvalue:
x+(y*z); // A C++ expression that produces a temporaryÂ 
C++ creates a temporary (an rvalue) that stores the result of y*z, and then adds it to x. Conceptually, this rvalue evaporates by the time you reach the semicolon at the end of the full expression.
