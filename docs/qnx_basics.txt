///@brief training from blueberry qnx

QNX:
Micro Kernel-> Process Management, Thread Management, Memory Management, I/O Management
Scheduling -> priorrity based(pre-emptive ??)



QNX is supported on x86, x86_64, CortexA
Not supported on CortexM


requirenment -> MMU (MPU is not requirenment)

MMU : 
H/W unit in uP
converts virtual address to physical address
Also provides protection(memory??)-> how? -> generates Interrupt -> kernel recieves it -> kernel suspends Process


QNX 7.10
separated QNX OS(SDP) and IDE(qnx momentics)

BSP??(Board Support package)

qccon
devccon

momentics -------------------------------> virtual machine or h/w target
            ethernet(target IP address)
        
jtag option available, lauterbag/ trace32

build process -> ifs.build file

IPC
for two process to communicate, 1 process need to open channel and other process need to have connection

IPC types
- Message(exchange info between 2 process)
- Pulses(deliver notification to process)
- signal(sends Interrupt to process)
